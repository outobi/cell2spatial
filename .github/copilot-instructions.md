# SpatialTranscriptomics R Package Development Instructions

This workspace is for developing an R package for spatial transcriptomics analysis with functions for:
- Cell type identification and comparison (wilcox.comp)
- Overlap enrichment analysis 
- Statistical comparisons and effect size calculations
- Gene signature scoring

## Project Structure
- R package following standard CRAN structure
- Functions converted from existing analysis scripts
- Proper documentation with roxygen2
- Unit tests and vignettes

## Development Guidelines
- Follow R package best practices
- Use roxygen2 for documentation
- Include comprehensive examples
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on IPF and spatial transcriptomics use cases
